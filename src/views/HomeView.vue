        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <!-- <div class="line"></div> -->
        <p class="max">Indo Villas is a luxury development project located in Avellanas with a collection of one 
          and two bedroom villas just steps from the ocean. The objective of Indo Villas is to fulfill a 
          thriving market segment with a residential oasis that satisfies customers' lifestyle, travel, and 
          wellness aspirations.</p>

        <h3>Why Avellanas?</h3>
        <p class="max">Avellanas and its neighboring towns are humming with higher net-worth ecotourism 
          that is commanding luxury accommodations, inspiring food & beverage venues, immediate 
          access to world-class waves, and attractive amenities emphasizing wellness as well as sustainability. 
          Today, there are insufficient options that match what the growing market is seeking in this region. 
          Additionally, the local municipality has approved to pave the final section of roads connecting all 
          of the premier beach communities.</p>
